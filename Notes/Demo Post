	Recently at my college campus, I had to enroll in a Spanish course. This gave me the opportunity to learn about a language I was somewhat familiar with but not by a long fold. With many top YouTube channels now being foreign it would only make sense to be able to take this to my advantage as a vlogger.

	This isn’t just useful for making videos on YouTube. Top sites like Udemy, also has Spanish versions of popular instructor courses. Being fluent in a new language isn’t easy. As you can tell, I am not even close. However, the way technology is going we can expect more than 25% of use will be speaking fluent Spanish worldwide. Being bilingual in 3 to 5 languages, or even more then that can increase your online presence.

	Take for example these top two videos, these videos I as a Coptic, am <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxrUN3xftk">reaching</a> out to other minorities in the Middle East. Keep in mind we use language as a way of communication. Right now I am trying to be fluent in at least 8 or more languages, this can help me reach a large audience, spread my message more, as well as talk about many different cultures. Languages can unite us, and being bilingual may be the new trend hitting the marketing, content writing, and technology world.
